1. **Create a virtual envrionment** wherever you want

---Installation---

```bash```

python3 -m venv <env_name>

source <env_name>/bin/activate


(Download the requirements.txt and run this command in your virtual envrionments terminal)

pip install -r requirements.txt

```bash```


2. **Usage**

---Keybindings---

U: Reloads all cylinders, replaces caps AND re adds them 
Y: Reloads all cylinders if you have *haven't* fired all bullets
I: Stops reloading immediately (after current bullet)


3. **WARNINGS**

-Do *NOT* use any binds while in first-person view, with shift lock on or while dragging the camera. The script *will* briefly spin your camera violently at the end of a reload
-Preferably reload in a safe area so the script can do its work


4. **Contributions**

Feel free to copy this and tinker to your hearts content. This is my first github project so it's definitely shit. I wont accept pull requests but I will read them as I want to preserve this so I can look back and see my growth. Have fun saving time on reloading this!
